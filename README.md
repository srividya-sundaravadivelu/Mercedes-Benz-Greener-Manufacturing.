We need to predict the time taken for the cars to pass testing. Since time is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. We will be using XGBoost Regressor to predict the time taken for cars to pass testing. Also, before applying the regression algorithm, we use PCA to reduce the no.of features in the dataset.
